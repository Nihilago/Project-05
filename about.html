            "2005" is a fictional streetwear lab that asks what would have happened if early‑2000s mall culture had
            taken a detour through a small gallery in the back of the city.

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
              The label lives in the tension between glossy Y2K futurism and awkward, art‑school silhouettes.
              Think chrome buckles, stacked platforms and anime prints cut into coats that drape a little too long and
              sweaters that warp around the body instead of sitting flat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every piece is designed as a clash: soft, almost nostalgic surfaces carrying shapes that feel slightly
              off, like a memory that does not line up perfectly with reality.
            </p>
            <div class="about-pill-row">
              <span class="about-pill">Y2K nostalgia</span>
              <span class="about-pill">Avantgarde silhouettes</span>
              <span class="about-pill">Street‑ready fabrics</span>

          <div>
            <h3>Pieces</h3>
            <p>
              The catalog sticks to familiar categories—hoodies, sweatpants, dresses, cargos, belts and platform
              shoes—but pushes each into costume territory.
              Knits are treated like armor, sweatpants are styled like runway trousers, and accessories carry most of
              the chrome hardware and logo energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some items lean hard into Y2K gloss, others into raw avantgarde shapes.
              The idea is that outfits come alive when those two moods collide in a single look, not when they are kept
              neatly separated.
            </p>

            <h3>Digital storefront</h3>
            <p>
              This site is built as a small online store mock‑up: a filtered catalog, gender toggles and a live basket,
              all skinned to feel like a tiny independent label testing its first web shop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the surface sits a simple Express backend and in‑memory cart.
              There is no checkout, no payment integration and no real stock—just interactions to click through and a
              mood to explore.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Why it exists</h3>
            <p>
              "2005" is primarily a code project: a place to experiment with storefront UX, filters and cart behavior
              while keeping the aesthetic tight and opinionated.
              The brand story exists to make the interface feel like a real shop, even though it might never leave the
              demo stage.
